### Infinity Bot is here to help you in everyday life on Discord, it contains many interesting features. 

#### Functionalities
  InfinityBot has special commands that will soon make your life easier on Discord. For example, it has a command that allows you to copy servers, which is useful for having a backup server. Speaking of backup, I present the backup command which allows to save in a document your server, the bot can save up to 5 backups per server. Obviously it contains the basic commands of a moderation bot, but still improved (you'll love the ban command). InfinityBot also has a command to detect the selfbots in your servers and ban them, it can also generate a captcha when a user enters the server, a firewall. In short InfinityBot is the bot you need.
